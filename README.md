## Deposit (DEP) RDF Schema

### Deposit classes

```
dep:Node - Node of a graph.
dep:Edge - Edge of a graph.
dep:Object - Unlabeled Node. Represents the analytical unit.
dep:Class - Labeled Node. Generalization (synthetical) unit. Only one Class with a specific label can exist.
dep:Member - Unlabeled Edge. Membership of an Object or Class in a Class.
dep:Relation - Labeled Edge. Connection between a Class and an Object or between Objects. Only one Relation between specific Nodes and with a specific label can exist.
dep:Order - rdf:Seq. Ordering of Nodes as specified by their position in a container of this class.
dep:CheckedOut - rdf:Bag. List of Nodes and Edges checked out from a parent Deposit graph.
dep:CheckedOutUpdated - rdf:Bag. List of Nodes and Edges checked out from a parent Deposit graph which have been updated.
dep:CheckedOutDeleted - rdf:Bag. List of Nodes and Edges checked out from a parent Deposit graph which have been deleted.
dep:CheckOutSource - rdfs:Resource. IRI of the source Deposit graph from which the current graph has been checked out.
dep:Changed - rdfs:Literal. Time of last change of a Deposit graph.
dep:Images - rdf:Bag. List of resources which are images.
```

### Deposit properties

```
dep:label - Label of a Node or Edge. Can be numeric, string, resource or geometry.
dep:geotag - Geometric information (wkt) further specifying a resource representing the label of an Edge. Coordinates represent pixels of the raster, [0,0] being the bottom-left corner.
dep:source - Indicates the source Node of an Edge.
dep:target - Indicates the target Node of an Edge.
dep:description - Additional description of a Class, Property or Relation.
dep:projection - Geographic projection as wkt in OGC or ESRI format of a resource representing the label of an Edge.
dep:worldfile_A..F - ESRI world file parameters used for georeferencing raster image resources.

Subclass: A Class which is a Member of another Class.

Descriptor: A Class connected to an Object by a Relation is a Descriptor of the Object and also of its Class. Only one identical Descriptor for a specific Object can exist.

Localy stored files are renamed to [uuid].[ext] and the original names are stored as triplets: uri rdfs:label Literal(name)

Resources are specified by an uri representing a file or online resource; file uri: "http://[Deposit server url]/deposit/file/[graph identifier]/[uuid].[ext]" or e.g. "http://some_server/filename.ext"

Geometry is specified by WKT and optionally EPSG code(s) in GeoSPARQL format stored as wktLiteral.
	e.g.: "<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/[srid]> Point(-83.1 34.4)"
	e.g.: "<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84> Polygon((-83.2 34.3, -83.0 34.3, -83.0 34.5, -83.2 34.3))"
	a vertical coordinate system can also be specified:
		e.g.: "<http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/[horizontal srid]> <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/[vertical srid]> Point(-83.1 34.4)"

Time stamp of last change of the Deposit graph is stored in a Literal
```

### RDFLib definitions

```
The Deposit RDF Schema IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier):
dep = http://future_url/2017/04/deposit-schema#

A Deposit graph RDF source IRI:
remote graph (served by a Deposit server):
	gra = http://[Deposit server url]/deposit/graph/[graph identifier]#
local graph (stored in a file system):
	gra = file:///[path/to/data]/[graph identifier]#

The GeoSPARQL schema IRI:
ogc = http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#
```
